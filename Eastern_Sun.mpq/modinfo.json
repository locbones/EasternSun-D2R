News 1 Title: "Eastern Sun Beta v0.9 Released!"
News 1 Message: "This is the first integrated Eastern Sun version that should also be compatible with D2RLaunch. While Tireheb's efforts on the conversion process have been put on hiatus until further notice, the community itself is still continuing work on the project. Please visit the ES Github for source files, PR Requests and more. Enjoy!"
News 2 Title: "D2RLaunch 2.0 has arrived!"
News 2 Message: "D2RLaunch has been re-built from the ground up to be more stable, more efficient and have improved functionality. It will look and behave very similarly to the old D2RLaunch; just now with a more dynamic UI and "professional" implementation. Please give special Thanks to @Alias and all his effort in spearheading this re-vamp. More details of the new and improved D2RLaunch can be found on our discord."
